# redshift copy in python
Python example for storing data in AWS Redshift

# movitation
This is a fairly simple task and the documentation in AWS is good.  However it's different than loading into mysql or postres or 
any other database and unless is a main part of what they do it's helpful to see a working copy.

In a production system you would normally not copy a file at a time, but instead you would use  
a manifest of several files and perform the copy command on the manifest file instead.  
But the idea is the same and I want to keep this simple.

* theres just one main program here
