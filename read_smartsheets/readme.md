# smartsheet reader
A utility to read data out of a smartsheets file.

# motivation
data comes from everywhere and sometimes the data we need to build a dimension is only available in someone elses work product.   
Perhaps we would eventually move the datasource to something else, but for now we just need to get the data with as little fuss as possible. This is just one example of that sort of requirement.   The Smartsheets documentation is good, but there are a few nuances with navigating the workplaces and folders that were not completely clear, and working sample may save some time if you eve need to do this.
